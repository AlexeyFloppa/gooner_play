# 🛠️ Contributing to Gonner Play

Yo! So you wanna contribute to **Gonner Play**? That’s awesome.
This project is a chaos-fueled playground for testing AI, automation, and weird ideas — all in cheat-style form (for fun and learning, not world domination… yet).

Whether you’re fixing bugs, adding a new cheat, or just want to drop a meme in a comment — you’re welcome here.

## 🧃 What Can You Contribute?

* 🧠 **New cheat modules** for other games (make sure it’s fun and weird)
* 🛠️ **Fix bugs** or polish existing ones (like the Cat Jump AI missing obvious jumps 💀)
* 🎛️ **Improve settings/config logic** so we can make dumber AI smarter
* 📱 **UI/UX ideas** that make it cooler or funnier
* 📄 **Docs** (like this file) or even tutorials for noobs
* 🧪 **Random experiments** that break things in a good way

## 🧼 How to Contribute

1. **Fork the repo**
2. Make your changes on a new branch
3. Test locally (especially if you're adding or changing a cheat)
4. Commit with a clear message
5. Open a pull request
6. Wait for feedback or a cat gif reaction

## 📦 Project Structure

Each cheat lives in its own module/folder, so nothing gets mixed up.
New modules should follow the same structure as `cat_jump/` — including:

* `logic.dart` or `brain.dart` — main cheat logic
* `config.dart` — for tweakable settings
* `ui.dart` — if it needs buttons/sliders for user input
* Any assets or custom files used

---

## 🧠 Tips

* Keep it **local-first** (no server stuff unless really needed)
* Make everything **configurable**
* Don’t take it too seriously 😼
* Test your stuff before submitting — at least make sure it runs
* If your cheat makes the cat smarter than the player, bonus points

Thanks for being a Gonner 💀🐾
Now go code something.
