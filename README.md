> Built for messing around, learning new tech, and making AI do dumb (but smart) stuff in games. Not for serious cheating or sweaty leaderboard climbing.

**Gonner Play** is a mobile app full of mini cheats — not the shady kind, but the “I built this to test AI and automation because it sounded cool” kind.
Each cheat is made to try out something new: local LLMs, input prediction, weird logic trees, and more.

## 🐱 Cat Jump – The First Victim

First test subject: **Cat Jump** — that chaotic vertical game where timing is everything and your cat has zero chill.

So… I made an AI that learns how to jump smarter.

### What it does:

* Uses a local mini AI (LLM) to figure out when and how to jump
* Tries to get more points, rarer stuff, and avoid falling like a noob
* Has a bunch of settings to tweak its brain (reaction time, priorities, etc)
* Doesn’t need internet, just vibes and CPU cycles

It's dumb. It's fun. It kinda works. And it’s all running on your phone.

## 🛠️ What I Used to Make the Magic

* **Flutter & Dart** for the app UI
* **Dart + Python logic** (depends on the module)
* **On-device AI stuff** so it runs offline
* **Custom config system** so you can poke the AI’s brain
* **Automation tools** for tapping, jumping, whatever

## 🚀 How to Run It

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AlexeyFloppa/gonner_play.git
cd gonner_play
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

Then just open it and let the cat cook 🐾
