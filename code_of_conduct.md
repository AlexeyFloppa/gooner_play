# 🧑‍💻 Code of Conduct

Welcome to **Gonner Play** — a chaotic little place where we build weird stuff, test AIs, and teach cats how to jump smarter.
While this is a fun project, basic respect still matters. So here’s the deal:

---

## 🤝 Be Cool

* Treat everyone with **respect**, no matter their skill level.
* **No hate speech, harassment, or personal attacks**. Ever.
* **Jokes are cool**, but don’t be a jerk.

---

## 💡 Help Don’t Gatekeep

* If someone’s new to AI, mobile dev, or Flutter, **help 'em out**.
  We were all noobs once (some of us still are, just louder).

---

## 💬 Keep It Chill

* Discussions, issues, and pull requests should stay **friendly and constructive**.
* If you disagree, explain why — don’t just say “this sucks.”

---

## 🚫 No Funny Business

* Don’t submit malicious code, spyware, or anything sus.
  We’re here to build cool stuff, not sneak around.

---

## 🙅‍♂️ Zero Tolerance

If someone’s being toxic, rude, or breaking the rules, they’ll be removed — no drama, just gone.

---

## 🐾 Final Words

This project is for **fun**, **learning**, and **experimentation**.
Keep it weird. Keep it kind. Let the AI cats do the evil stuff 😼

---

If you have questions or wanna report something weird, open an issue or DM the repo owner.

Thanks for being a decent human. Now go build something broken on purpose.
